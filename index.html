            <p>  Hello fellow quarantine buddies! Welcome to the Quarantine Chronicles, a blog where I post about how I'm trying to improve my life
                while in a pandemic world. I'm sure plenty of you can relate, so follow along and see what I get up to. Today I'm figuring out how to workout.
                On most days I would just hop in my car and drive to the gym for a quick workout. But the gym I used to go to is closed and will not be
                reopening. As a result, I'm stuck at home wondering how I'm going to keep myself in shape. If I'm quarantined how am I supposed to exercise,
                there's nowhere to go. I felt a little panicked about it for a while until I found an instagram post on calisthenics. I looked more into 
                it and found that calisthenics is very easy to start up. The whole idea of calisthenics is to use your bodyweight to build muscle.
                That includes exercises such as,</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Pushups</li>
                    <li>Squats</li>
                    <li>Pull Ups</li>
                    <li>Situps</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                and much much more. With simple exercises such as these working out should be a breeze. I should be able to knockout a quick circuit
                in 30 - 45 minutes. So for the rest of the week I am going to do my best to stay consistent with my workouts. That way at the end of 
                the week I can look back on the week and see if I progressed. Tune in next week for my results on calisthenics!

            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>I said I would update you all on my results from my calisthenics, so here they are. It took some hard work and determination, but 
                I managed to finish all the workouts this week. I did max pushups, squats, pull ups and situps. Here's how it turned out.

<p>   If it's not broken don't throw it away. That was the phrase that I heard quite often while growing up. My grandfather was a naturalist,
    which meant that nature conservation was drilled into my head from a young age. He would reuse anything and everything that he could.
    Mason jars were cups, boxes were used as flooring, and tennis balls were chair leg coverings. Everything that I thought was trash never was.
    Now I have moved into a new house with new roomates. These roomates evidently did not have a grandfather who was as passionate about 
    conservation as mine was. They throw everything away and barely recycle. So this week I am going to do my best to push recycling, composting, 
    and overall respect for the planet more on to my roomates. Because the planet needs help. There is a pandemic going around taking over the
    news sources, but it's not the only issue. Climate change is going to do more damage to the planet unless we decide to do something about it.
    Reusing simple household items is a good start, but it's not enough. The more everyone does to help support the planet, the better
    it will be. Overall it starts with one, so why can't the one be me. Let's clean up the planet and make everything safer for us!

        Just a friendly reminder to everyone out there that there is a pandemic going on. Make sure to stay socially distant from your peers, wash
        your hands, wear a mask, and try your best to have a little bit of fun in these tough times!
