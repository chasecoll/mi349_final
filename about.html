<h3>What Do We Do?</h3>
<p>Techagain is a Nonprofit that specializes in the redistribution of used technology. We operate through our wonderful volunteers who
    answer phone calls, drive and load used technology, and help to pack up the old items for shipping. The technology is then shipped to one
    of our many areas of need, where local volunteers help to make sure it gets into the right hands.
</p>

<h3>Where Do You Ship To?</h3>
<p>We ship our used technology all around the globe. We have shipped to countries in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, South America, and North America.
    Our last project supplied a small village near Chile with several phones and a dozen computers.</p>

<h3>What Items Do You Collect?</h3>  
<p>We collect and redistribute Cell Phones, Computers, Televisions, Projectros, Monitors, Projectors, Keyboards, and Mice. 
    Please wipe off the item with a disenfecting wipe before donating it. And make sure the item is in good working condition.
